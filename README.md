# ShoppingListApp
Shopping list site. 

You can add and delete items from the list, like in any shopping list.
You can also add recipe ingredients to a recipe database/book, that you can easily view. 
You can then select recipes to add the ingredients to the shopping list. 
When adding recipes to your recipe database, you can state what ingredients you commonly have in your pantry. Then, when you add that recipe to your shopping list, it will by default not add those items, and instead ask you to select the common pantry items you want to add. 
You can add categories to ingredients - you can then sort by those categories, so that it matches the order of aisles at the supermarket. (Iâ€™m soon going to add a settings modal where you can choose the categories and their order). 
Autocomplete features - it will remember past ingredients you have added and their categories and whether they are common pantry items. 
You can also edit recipes.
